# Gas-cooled Microreactor Assembly Model Description

The Gas-Cooled Microreactor (GC-MR) core model with bypass flow is a thermal hydraulics model that can be used to evaluate the impact of the inter-assembly bypass flow on the fuel temperatures. For simplicity, no neutronics is included in this model and the power density is prescribed. The design is from [!citep](Duchnowski2022). The core layout is modified to include assemblies in the corners for compatibility with the available meshes in Pronghorn-SC as shown in [core_layout].
